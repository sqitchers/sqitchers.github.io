		<p>Sqitch is a database change management application. What makes it different from
your typical migration-style approaches? A few things:</p>
<section class="db">
<h2 id="no-opinions">No Opinions</h2>
<p>Sqitch is not tied to any framework, ORM, or platform. Rather, it is a
standalone change management system with no opinions about your database engine,
application framework, or development environment.
</section>
<section class="cli">
<h2 id="native-scripting">Native scripting</h2>
<p>Changes are implemented as scripts native to your selected database engine.
Writing a <a href="https://postgresql.org/" title="PostgreSQL: The World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database">PostgreSQL</a> application? Write SQL scripts for <code>psql</code>. Writing a
<a href="https://mysql.com/" title="MySQL: The world's most popular open source database">MySQL</a>-backed app? Write SQL scripts for <code>mysql</code>.
</section>
<section class="depend">
<h2 id="dependency-resolution">Dependency resolution</h2>
<p>Database changes may declare dependencies on other changes &mdash; even changes from
other Sqitch projects. This ensures proper order of execution, even when you&rsquo;ve
committed changes to your VCS out-of-order.
</section>
<section class="hash">
<h2 id="deployment-integrity">Deployment integrity</h2>
<p>Sqitch manages changes and dependencies via a plan file, employing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree" title="Wikipedia: “Merkle tree”">Merkle
tree</a> pattern similar to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/18589734/" title="Stack Overflow: “What is the mathematical structure that represents a Git repo”">Git</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/byzantine-studio/blockchain-fundamentals-what-is-a-merkle-tree-d44c529391d7" title="Medium: “Blockchain Fundamentals #1: What is a Merkle Tree?”">Blockchain</a> to ensure deployment integrity.
As such, there is no need to number your changes, although you can if you want.
Sqitch doesn&rsquo;t much care how you name your changes.
</section>
<section class="dev">
<h2 id="iterative-development">Iterative development</h2>
<p>Up until you <a href="/docs/manual/sqitch-tag/">tag</a> and <a href="/docs/manual/sqitch-bundle/" title="Sqitch commands: bundle">release</a> your application, you
can modify your change deployment scripts as often as you like. They&rsquo;re not
locked in just because they&rsquo;ve been committed to your VCS. This allows you to
take an iterative or test-driven approach to developing your database schema.
